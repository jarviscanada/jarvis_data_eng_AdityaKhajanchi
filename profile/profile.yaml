    git_url: "/python_data_analytics"
    description: "Designed a system architecture diagram outlining the end-to-end data flow---from raw CSV ingestion to processed insights and final dashboard outputs---to support scalable analysis for London Gift Shop (LGS), an online retail business. Built a Python-based data analytics proof of concept (PoC) that included data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using `pandas`, `NumPy`, and visualization libraries like `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`, and `Folium`. Engineered logic to detect null values, correct data types, and enrich records by mapping countries to continents. Created interactive charts to uncover sales trends, regional patterns, and customer behaviors. Developed a Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) matrix to segment customers and guide targeted marketing. Showcased proficiency in Python scripting, statistical analysis, data wrangling, and building insight-driven visual narratives to support retail decision-making."
  - name: "BSA Fundamentals"
    git_url: "/bsa"
    description:
      "Completed a hands-on Business Systems Analyst training project focused on two core deliverables. 
      First, authored a comprehensive Business Requirements Document (BRD) for a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent solution to support automated, real-time resource tracking across up to 100 Rocky Linux servers.
      The BRD defined project scope, functional and non-functional requirements, stakeholder roles, and a cost-benefit analysis to guide development.
      Second, conducted an in-depth interview with a business stakeholder to gather requirements for a stock trading application.
      Based on the insights, developed a System Requirements Document (SRD) for the software development lead, clearly outlining business goals, functional specifications, user needs, and system behavior to support informed development planning."

    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: "Developed an interactive Chicago crime heatmap dashboard using Dash and Plotly, allowing users to filter data by crime type, month, or view all available data. Leveraged real-time data from the City of Chicago's public SOD API, utilizing Pandas for data manipulation and Plotly's density_mapbox for visualizing crime density on an interactive map. Implemented dynamic dropdowns, checklists, and callbacks to enable real-time filtering and updates. Integrated Mapbox for precise geographical mapping and customized the user interface with CSS for an enhanced user experience. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of crime trends and hotspots across the city."

    description: "Collaborated with a team of 7 to develop the Global Superstore Dashboard, an interactive data visualization tool aimed at providing in-depth insights into sales, profit, shipping, and customer segmentation for a global retail operation. Using Dash and Plotly, we built a dynamic dashboard that allows users to explore Year-to-Date (YTD) metrics, such as total sales, orders, and products sold, alongside key performance indicators like sales growth and shipping time. Leveraging Pandas for data processing, we incorporated advanced charts, including area charts, sunburst, funnel, and waterfall plots, to visually present trends, geographical distributions, and customer behavior. The dashboard also integrates dynamic filters, allowing users to select different report types and years for flexible data exploration. This project successfully delivered an intuitive platform for management to analyze real-time business performance and make informed decisions."
