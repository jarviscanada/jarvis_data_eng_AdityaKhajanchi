## Stocks Dashboard

**Description**:  
This dashboard offers a dynamic and interactive view of stock performance using live data from Alpha Vantage. It shows historical trends, key financial indicators, candlestick charts, analyst estimates, and financial ratios Â— all customizable by ticker and time range.

**Use Case**:  
Designed for individual investors, finance analysts, and portfolio managers who want a quick yet insightful overview of any listed stock's financial health and market performance. It can be extended into a lightweight investment monitoring tool.

**Data Sources**:
- Alpha Vantage API (`TIME_SERIES_DAILY`, `OVERVIEW`, and `EARNINGS_CALENDAR`)
- Real-time JSON data transformed via Power Query (M Language)
- Company logos dynamically loaded using the [Logo.dev API](https://www.logo.dev/)

**Key Features**:
-  **Time Period Slicer** with custom logic and DAX measures to change the chart date range (1mo to 5yr, MAX)
-  **Candlestick Visual** from AppSource for technical stock charting
-  **Dynamic Parameters** to change stock tickers without rewriting the query
-  **Cards for Financial Indicators**: Analyst Target Price, 52-Week High/Low, Dividend Yield, P/E Ratio
-  **Stacked Column and Line Charts** for combined Volume and Price view
-  **Company Overview Section** with dynamic logo, description, and exchange info
-  **Financial Ratios Panel** with real-time data

**Constraints**:
- Free Alpha Vantage API has a **25-request/day limit** which may restrict usage across multiple tickers.
- Dashboard performance may lag slightly due to real-time API calls and transformations.
- Some financial indicators (like EPS, beta, or industry averages) are not yet included.

**Future Improvements**:
- Add **multi-stock comparison** on the same chart (e.g., MSFT vs AAPL).
- Introduce **alert indicators** (e.g., stock nearing 52-week low/high).
- Create a **bookmark-based navigation flow** (Home > Chart > Financials).
- Make it **mobile-responsive** for easier review on tablets or phones.
- Include **automated daily refresh** and scheduled snapshot sharing via email.
- Add **explanation tooltips** for key ratios so that even non-finance users understand them.
